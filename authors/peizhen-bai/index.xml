Both machine learning experts and end users can do better research with our accessible, scalable, and sustainable design, guided by green machine learning principles. PyKale has a unified pipeline-based API and focuses on multimodal learning and transfer learning for graphs, images, texts, and videos at the moment, with supporting models on deep learning and dimensionality reduction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PyKale enforces standardization and minimalism, via green machine learning concepts of reducing repetitions and redundancy, reusing existing resources, and recycling learning models across areas. PyKale will enable and accelerate interdisciplinary, knowledge-aware machine learning research for graphs, images, texts, and videos in applications including bioinformatics, graph analysis, image/video recognition, and medical imaging, with an overarching theme of leveraging knowledge from multiple sources for accurate and interpretable prediction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Low-Bias Evaluation of Drug-Target Interaction</title><link>https://haipinglu.github.io/project/dti-graph-eval/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://haipinglu.github.io/project/dti-graph-eval/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project is in collaboration with AstraZeneca.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is important in drug discovery and chemogenomics studies. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has advanced this area significantly over the past few years. However, a significant gap between the performance reported in academic papers and that in practical drug discovery settings, e.g. the random-split-based evaluation strategy tends to be too optimistic in estimating the prediction performance in real-world settings. Such performance gap is largely due to hidden data bias in experimental datasets and inappropriate data split.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project, we construct a low-bias DTI dataset and study more challenging data split strategies to improve performance evaluation for real-world settings. Specifically, we study the data bias in a popular DTI dataset, BindingDB, and re-evaluate the prediction performance of three state-of-the-art deep learning models using five different data split strategies: random split, cold drug split, scaffold split, and two hierarchical-clustering-based splits. In addition, we comprehensively examine six performance metrics. Our experimental results confirm the overoptimism of the popular random split and show that hierarchical-clustering-based splits are far more challenging and can provide potentially more useful assessment of model generalizability in real-world DTI prediction settings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hierarchical clustering split for low-bias evaluation of drug-target interaction prediction</title><link>https://haipinglu.github.io/publication/bai-2021-hierarchical/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://haipinglu.github.io/publication/bai-2021-hierarchical/</guid><description/></item><item><title>PyKale: Knowledge-aware machine learning from multiple sources in python</title><link>https://haipinglu.github.io/publication/lu-2021-pykale/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://haipinglu.github.io/publication/lu-2021-pykale/</guid><description/></item><item><title>GripNet: Graph information propagation on supergraph for heterogeneous graphs</title><link>https://haipinglu.github.io/publication/xu-2020-gripnet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://haipinglu.github.io/publication/xu-2020-gripnet/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Joint interaction with context operation for collaborative filtering</title><link>https://haipinglu.github.io/publication/bai-2019-joint/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://haipinglu.github.io/publication/bai-2019-joint/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
